# Foreign Key Constraint Fix Summary

## Problem
When trying to delete a user account, the system was throwing an integrity constraint violation error because foreign key constraints were set to `RESTRICT` or `CASCADE` instead of `SET NULL`.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Foreign Key Constraints

All foreign key constraints referencing the `users` table have been updated to use `ON DELETE SET NULL`:

1. **resource_access_logs.user_id**
   - Changed from: `ON DELETE CASCADE`
   - Changed to: `ON DELETE SET NULL`
   - Effect: When a user is deleted, their access logs remain but user_id is set to NULL

2. **resources.created_by**
   - Changed from: `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
   - Changed to: `ON DELETE SET NULL`
   - Effect: When a user is deleted, resources they created remain but created_by is set to NULL

3. **resource_bookings.approved_by**
   - Changed from: `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
   - Changed to: `ON DELETE SET NULL`
   - Effect: When a user is deleted, bookings they approved remain but approved_by is set to NULL

### Constraints Left as CASCADE (Intentional)

These constraints remain as `ON DELETE CASCADE` because the data should be deleted when the user is deleted:

1. **resource_bookings.user_id** - User's bookings are deleted with the user
2. **role_user.user_id** - User's role assignments are deleted with the user

## How to Test

1. Login as an administrator
2. Go to User Profile
3. Click "Delete Account"
4. Enter password and confirm
5. User should be deleted successfully
6. Related records (resources, bookings, access logs) will have NULL for the user reference

## Database Changes Made

```sql
-- Made columns nullable
ALTER TABLE resources MODIFY created_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;
ALTER TABLE resource_bookings MODIFY approved_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;

-- Updated foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE resources 
  DROP FOREIGN KEY resources_created_by_foreign,
  ADD CONSTRAINT resources_created_by_foreign 
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE resource_bookings 
  DROP FOREIGN KEY resource_bookings_approved_by_foreign,
  ADD CONSTRAINT resource_bookings_approved_by_foreign 
  FOREIGN KEY (approved_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE resource_access_logs 
  DROP FOREIGN KEY resource_access_logs_user_id_foreign,
  ADD CONSTRAINT resource_access_logs_user_id_foreign 
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## Verification

Run this command to verify all constraints:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then:

```php
DB::select("
    SELECT 
        rc.TABLE_NAME,
        rc.CONSTRAINT_NAME,
        kcu.COLUMN_NAME,
        kcu.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
        rc.DELETE_RULE
    FROM 
        information_schema.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS rc
    JOIN
        information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE kcu
        ON rc.CONSTRAINT_NAME = kcu.CONSTRAINT_NAME
    WHERE 
        rc.CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = 'sprms'
        AND kcu.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'users'
");
```

Expected output should show:
- `resource_access_logs.user_id` → `DELETE_RULE: SET NULL`
- `resources.created_by` → `DELETE_RULE: SET NULL`
- `resource_bookings.approved_by` → `DELETE_RULE: SET NULL`
- `resource_bookings.user_id` → `DELETE_RULE: CASCADE`
- `role_user.user_id` → `DELETE_RULE: CASCADE`

## Status

✅ All foreign key constraints have been fixed
✅ User deletion now works without constraint violations
✅ Historical data is preserved with NULL references
✅ Application caches have been cleared

## Notes

- Users can now be safely deleted from the system
- Analytics data is preserved even after user deletion
- Resources and bookings created/approved by deleted users remain in the system
- The system maintains data integrity while allowing user account deletion
