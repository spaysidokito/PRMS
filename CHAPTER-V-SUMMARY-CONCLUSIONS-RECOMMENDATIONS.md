# SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## Summary of Findings

For the past years, the Office of Student Affairs at St. Anne College Lucena, Inc. has struggled with fragmented systems and manual processes for managing student records, coordinating events, distributing resources, and processing form submissions. In response to these challenges, PRIMOSA was developed to provide a unified platform that centralizes student affairs operations. From the data gathered, listed below are the derived findings:

1. Through the use of observation, interview, and research as part of the data gathering techniques, it helped the proponent to articulate the core requirements needed to develop the system.

2. In order to elucidate the functionality and interactions of the system, the Unified Modeling Language was applied as a tool to scheme the logical and physical design. Diagrams such as use case, activity, and sequence revealed the process of the system while the deployment diagram shows how the system will be deployed in real-time environment.

3. As a development platform, Laravel 11 framework with PHP 8.2+ was accustomed using Livewire 3 for dynamic components and Tailwind CSS 3.4 for responsive design. The methodology Agile with Iterative Framework was used as a basis and guide to successfully polish the study.

4. With the help of evaluation and testing, the proponent was able to distinguish whether the software passed the ISO/IEC 25010 system criteria. Based on the responses and comments collected, it was understood that the content of the system was accurate and useful. Moreover, PRIMOSA delivers quickly the needed data. In addition, students, faculty, and staff are eager to make this as the centralized platform for OSA operations providing a wider scope and detailed information as it is a helpful tool that attends to the concerns of administrators, staff, and students. Finally, as assessed by the SACLI administration, it was said that the system is a great development.

## Conclusions

Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. From the gathered data through the use of interview, observation, and research, needed information were collected to conceptualize the requirements for the beneficiaries.

2. Utilizing UML diagrams such as use case, activity, sequence, and deployment diagram, clear visual interface was deliberated for easy navigation which helped the end-users have an easy-to-follow illustration about the processes and interactions of one another.

3. The software tools used to design and develop the system such as Laravel 11 framework with PHP 8.2+, Livewire 3, Tailwind CSS 3.4, and MySQL 8.0+ were able to build fully-functional web-based management system. With the help of Agile methodology with Iterative Framework, the procedure and steps served as the guide to effectuate the defined requirements.

4. The results of the evaluation and testing revealed that the system passed based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. From the comments gathered, it can be concluded that this could be a helpful tool from the point of view of students, faculty/staff, and administrators.

## Recommendations

From the drawn conclusions, these recommendations were agreed to further enhance the functionality of the system:

1. Future researchers should include a vast scope of information and features not tackled in the system.

2. Future researchers should assign a technical administrator who could manage the system for maintenance and updates.

3. Future researchers should make the system more dynamic by including real-time notifications and automated reporting features.

4. Future researchers should improve the analytics dashboard by integrating advanced data visualization tools such as Chart.js or D3.js.

5. Future researchers should make a mobile application version (Android and iOS) of this study.

6. Future researchers could integrate an advanced and progressive technology, i.e. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to enhance decision-making, predictive analytics, and automated assistance.
